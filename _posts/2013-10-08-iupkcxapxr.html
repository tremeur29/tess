source: "wyrdmorrish: We chaste girls and boys Are under the tutelage of Diana: Chaste boys and girls Let us sing to Diana. O daughter of Leto, Great offspring of greatest Jove, Your mother bore you Near the Delian olive tree, So you might be mistress of the mountains And of the growing woods And of the secluded woodland glades And of the sounding rivers: You are called Lucina Juno By women in the pains of childbirth, You are called powerful Trivia and You are called Luna by your borrowed light. You, goddess, in your monthly course Marking off the journey of the year, You fill up the rural hut Of the farmer with good crops. By whatever name pleases you May you be hallowed, And as you have been accustomed to before, may you Preserve the offspring of Romulus with good aid. http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catullus_34  "
