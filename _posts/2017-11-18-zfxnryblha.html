<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="">franz-aussie</a>:</p>
<p>I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me<br/>
She showed me her room, isn’t it good, norwegian wood?<br/>
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere<br/>
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn’t a chair<br/>
I sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br/>
We talked until two and then she said, “It’s time for bed”<br/>
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br/>
I told her I didn’t and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br/>
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown<br/>
So I lit a fire, isn’t it good, norwegian wood?</p>
