<p>Dear lanes of Cornwall! With a one-inch map,<br/>
A bicycle and well-worn “Little Guide”,<br/>
Those were the years I used to ride for miles<br/>
To far-off churches. One of them that year<br/>
So worked on me that, if my life was changed,<br/>
I owe it to St. Ervan and his priest<br/>
In their small hollow deep in sycamores.<br/>
The time was tea-time, calm free-wheeling time,<br/>
When from slashed tree-tops in the combe below<br/>
I heard a bell-note floating to the sun;<br/>
It gave significance to lichened stone<br/>
And large red admirals with outspread wings<br/>
Basking on buddleia. So, casting down<br/>
In the cool shade of interlacing boughs,<br/>
I found St. Ervan’s partly ruined church.</p>

<p>There wasn’t much to see, there wasn’t much<br/>
The “Little Guide” could say about the church.<br/>
Holy and small and heavily restored,<br/>
It held me for the length of Evensong,<br/>
Said rapidly among discoloured walls,<br/>
Impatient of my diffident response.<br/>
“Better come in and have a cup of tea.”<br/>
The Rectory was large, uncarpeted;<br/>
Books and oil-lamps and papers were about;<br/>
The study’s pale green walls were mapped with damp;<br/>
The pitch-pine doors and window-frames were cracked;<br/>
Loose noisy tiles along the passages<br/>
Led to a waste of barely furnished rooms:<br/>
Clearly the Rector lived here all alone.</p>

<p>He talked of poetry and Cornish saints;<br/>
He kept an apiary and a cow;<br/>
He asked me which church service I liked best—<br/>
I told him Evensong … “And I suppose<br/>
You think religion’s mostly singing hymns<br/>
And feeling warm and comfortable inside?”<br/>
And he was right: most certainly I did.<br/>
“Borrow this book and come to tea again.”<br/>
With Arthur Machen’s <i>Secret Glory</i> stuffed<br/>
Into my blazer pocket, up the hill<br/>
On to St. Merryn, down to Padstow Quay<br/>
In time for the last ferry back to Rock,<br/>
I bicycled—and found Trebetherick<br/>
A worldly contrast with my afternoon.</p>

<p>I would not care to read that book again.<br/>
It so exactly mingled with the mood<br/>
Of those impressionable years, that now<br/>
I might be disillusioned. There were laughs<br/>
At public schools, at chapel services,<br/>
At masters who were still “big boys at heart”—<br/>
While all the time the author’s hero knew<br/>
A Secret Glory in the hills of Wales:<br/>
Caverns of light revealed the Holy Grail<br/>
Exhaling gold upon the mountain-tops;<br/>
At “Holy! Holy! Holy!” in the Mass<br/>
King Brychan’s sainted children crowded round,<br/>
And past and present were enwrapped in one.</p>

<p>In quest of mystical experience<br/>
I knelt in darkness at St. Enodoc;<br/>
I visited our local Holy Well,<br/>
Whereto the native Cornish still resort<br/>
For cures for whooping-cough, and drop bent pins<br/>
Into its peaty water … Not a sign:<br/>
No mystical experience was vouchsafed:<br/>
The maidenhair just trembled in the wind<br/>
And everything looked as it always looked … <br/>
But somewhere, somewhere underneath the dunes,<br/>
Somewhere among the cairns or in the caves<br/>
The Celtic saints would come to me, the ledge<br/>
Of time we walk on, like a thin cliff-path<br/>
High in the mist, would show the precipice.</p>
