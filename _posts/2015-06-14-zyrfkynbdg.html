In those times the Russian North was a wealthy trading region, with numerous cities and villages. Wooden architecture is traditional to the Russian North; and the best examples of it still survived. Despite nowadays the situation with the economics and population in the region is merely disastrous. (By the way Zvyagintsev’s movie “Leviathan”is set  in the Russian North)  "
