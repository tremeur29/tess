source: "fuckyeahhistorycrushes:  Sultan Abdülmecid I ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1823 to 1861. He was most famous for his efforts in trying to unite and modernize the Ottoman Empire through the Tanzimat reforms. However the sultan’s greatest act of kindness was in 1847 as Ireland was in the grips of the Great Famine. After hearing about the famine from his Irish doctor, Abdülmecid had decided to send 10,000 pounds in aid. However Queen Victoria, who only sent 2000 pounds to help Ireland, did not want to be outdone by Abdülmecid’s more generous offer and ordered him to send only a 1000 pounds. Although Abdülmecid did agree to this offer, secretly he sent three ships filled with food and provisions to the Irish town of Drogheda.  Sultan Abdülmecid pretty much won my heart after giving Queen Victoria a symbolic middle finger and helped hundreds of people who were starving, all in one beautiful story.   "
