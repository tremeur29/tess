<p>Walton did not take his work with the greatest seriousness. He called the baritone solo about the wealth of Babylon “the shopping list” and at a Hoffnung festival concert, he conducted a large choir and orchestra in “an excerpt from Belshazzar’s Feast”: Walton raised his baton, and the chorus bellowed the single word “slain”. He then put down his baton, shook hands with the baritone soloist, who had not sung a note, and they both bowed and left the platform to gales of applause.<p>
