source: "“Between the Convent of Mount Anville, above Dundrum, and the broad high road which leads to the pretty village of Stillorgan, rises the wooded hill of Mount Merrion, the centre of the landscape over Dublin Bay, which gradually becomes defined as the opalescent mists of the Irish sunrise fade away. … Around the wood some three hundred acres of the richest grazing land in County Dublin slope gently to the high stone wall which surrounds the demesne. To the south and south-west the horizon is bounded by the swelling outline of the Wicklow and Dublin Hills. To the north the long low line of the Mourne Mountains, sixty miles and more away, are clearly visible when recent rains have left the washed air clear, while the islands of Lambay and Ireland’s Eye give an added beauty to the sea-scape which lies beyond the wind-blown causeway which leads on and up to the rhododendron covered slopes above the ancient castle of Howth.” (via) "
