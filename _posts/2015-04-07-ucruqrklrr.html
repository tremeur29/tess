source: "russian-style:Kazimir Malevich - Red Square (Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimensions), 1915.I like how Boris Groys writes on Malevich: “Malevich shows us what it means to be a revolutionary artist. It means joining the universal material flow that destroys all temporary political and aesthetic orders. Here, the goal is not change—understood as change from an existing, “bad” order to a new, “good” order. Rather, revolutionary art abandons all goals—and enters the non-teleological, potentially infinite process which the artist cannot and does not want to bring to an end”. "
