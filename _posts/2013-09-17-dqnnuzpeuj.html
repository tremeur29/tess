source: "honeygsweetescape:  HISTORY MEME - 3/6 WOMEN - PHILIPPA OF HAINAULT, QUEEN OF ENGLAND Philippa, born Philippa d’Avesnes in Valenciennes, married Edward III at York Minster, on 24 January 1328, eleven months after his accession to the English throne. Unlike many of her predecessors, Philippa did not alienate the English people by retaining her foreign retinue upon her marriage or by bringing large numbers of foreigners to the English court. Philippa accompanied Edward on his expeditions to Scotland, and the European continent in his early campaigns of the Hundred Years War where she won acclaim for her gentle nature and compassion. She is best remembered as the kind woman who, in 1347, persuaded her husband to spare the lives of the Burghers of Calais, whom he had planned to execute as an example to the townspeople following his successful siege of that city. She acted as regent in England on several occasions when her husband was away from his kingdom. She also influenced the king to take an interest in the nation’s commercial expansion. Philippa was a patron of the chronicler Jean Froissart, and she owned several illuminated manuscripts, one of which currently is housed in the national library in Paris. Philippa also is known to be the “most royal” Queen consort of England due to four of her great-great-grandfathers having been kings of France, Aragon, Naples, and Hungary.  ❝ Tall and upright was she, wise, gay, humble, pious, liberal and courteous, decked and adorned in her time with all noble virtues, beloved of God and of mankind… And so long as she lived, the kingdom of England had favour, prosperity, honour and every sort of good fortune; neither did famine or dearth remain in the land during her reign, and so you will find it recorded in history ❞ — Jean Froissart.
