source: "books0977:  Self-Portrait with Death as a Fiddler (1872). Arnold Böcklin (Swiss, 1827-1901). Oil on canvas. Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. Death is playing on the lowest string, tuned to G, which is here the only string on the fiddle. The painter, alert, has paused in his work. According to the story, Böcklin only painted in the figure of Death in response to friends asking him to what he was listening. This relates to the search for the ultimate, and the inspiration drawn from the proximity of death.  "
