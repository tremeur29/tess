<p>Where are the holy apostles gone,<br/>
Vestured with albs and silken stoled,<br/>
That hooded were with amice alone,<br/>
The laying on of whose hands controlled<br/>
The folk upon whom the fiend had hold?<br/>
All must come to the self-same bay;<br/>
Sons and servants, their days are told:<br/>
The wind carries them all away.</p>

<p>Where is he now that held the throne<br/>
Of Constantine with the hands of gold?<br/>
And the King of France, whose name is known<br/>
Over all kings as great and bold, &mdash;<br/>
That builded cathedrals manifold,<br/>
That he unto God might homage pay?<br/>
Availeth not honour they had of old:<br/>
The wind carries them all away.</p>

<p>Where are the champions every one,<br/>
The Dauphins, the counsellors young and old?<br/>
The barons of Salins, D&ocirc;l, Dijon,<br/>
Vienne, Grenoble? They all are cold.<br/>
Or take the folk under their banners enrolled, &mdash;<br/>
Pursuivants, trumpeters, heralds, &mdash; say,<br/>
Where are they now but under the mould?<br/>
The wind carries them all away.&lt;/p>

<p>Princes to death are all foretold,<br/>
Even as the humblest of their array:<br/>
Whether they sorrow or whether they scold,<br/>
The wind carries them all away.</p>
