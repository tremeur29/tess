source: "bbcradio3:  John Betjeman made his first appearance on the brand new Third Programme on this day in 1946. He gave a talk about Evelyn Waugh in the series ‘Living Writers’. Betjeman was already a BBC veteran, though, and, by the time of his death in 1984, would have made 800 appearances on BBC TV and radio. The picture was taken in a BBC radio studio in 1953. Note the fug of cigarette smoke.  "
