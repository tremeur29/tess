<p>I was born in Belfast between the mountain and the gantries<br/>
To the hooting of lost sirens and the clang of trams:<br/>
Thence to Smoky Carrick in County Antrim<br/>
Where the bottle-neck harbour collects the mud which jams.</p>

<p>The little boats beneath the Norman castle,<br/>
The pier shining with lumps of crystal salt;<br/>
The Scotch Quarter was a line of residential houses<br/>
But the Irish Quarter was a slum for the blind and halt.</p>

<p>The brook ran yellow from the factory stinking of chlorine,<br/>
The yarn-milled called its funeral cry at noon;<br/>
Our lights looked over the Lough to the lights of Bangor<br/>
Under the peacock aura of a drowning moon.</p>

<p>The Norman walled this town against the country<br/>
To stop his ears to the yelping of his slave<br/>
And built a church in the form of a cross but denoting<br/>
The List of Christ on the cross, in the angle of the nave.</p>

<p>I was the rector’s son, born to the Anglican order,<br/>
Banned for ever from the candles of the Irish poor;<br/>
The Chichesters knelt in marble at the end of a transept<br/>
With ruffs about their necks, their portion sure.</p>

<p>The war came and a huge camp of soldiers<br/>
Grew from the ground in sight of our house with long<br/>
Dummies hanging from gibbets for bayonet practice<br/>
And the sentry’s challenge echoing all day long.</p>

<p>I went to school in Dorset, the world of parents<br/>
Contracted into a puppet world of sons<br/>
Far from the mill girls, the smell of porter, the salt mines<br/>
And the soldiers with their guns.</p>
