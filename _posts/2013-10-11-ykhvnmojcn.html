<p>I think one of the saddest things is when two people really get to know each other: their secrets, their fears, their favourite things, what they love, what they hate, literally everything, and then they go back to being strangers. Itâ€™s like you have to walk past them and pretend like you never knew them, never even talked to them before, when really, you know everything about them.</p>
