source: "My dad had a savings account set up when he was born, in 1949. In 1962, shortly before turning thirteen, its balance was one pound. He withdrew nineteen shillings and left the twentieth shilling in the bank for thirty-seven years. In 1999, aged forty-nine, he closed his account, withdrawing five pence [decimal equivalent of one shilling] plus £3.93, nearly fifty years’ worth of interest. "
