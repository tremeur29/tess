<p>Do you remember 1926? That summer of soups and speeches,<br/>
The sunlight on the idle wheels and the deserted crossings,<br/>
And the laughter and the cursing in the moonlight streets?<br/>
Do you remember 1926? The slogans and the penny concerts,<br/>
The jazz-bands and the moorland picnics,<br/>
And the slanderous tongues of famous cities?<br/>
Do you remember 1926? The great dream and the swift disaster,<br/>
The fanatic and the traitor, and more than all,<br/>
The bravery of the simple, faithful folk?<br/>
“Ay, ay, we remember 1926,” said Dai and Shinkin,<br/>
As they stood on the kerb in Charing Cross Road,<br/>
“And we shall remember 1926 until our blood is dry.”</p>
