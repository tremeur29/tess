<p><b><small>From border to border, by valley and mountain,<br/>Where only the eagle sails proudly along.<br/>Of Stalin the wise, the dearly beloved,<br/>The hearts of the people are weaving a song.</small></b></p>
<p><small>More swift than the eagle this song goes a-winging<br/>And sets the oppressor to trembling with fright.<br/>No barb-wired border, no fortified outpost<br/>Can halt the clear music’s unfaltering flight.</small></p>
<p><b><small>No whip and no bullet can smash it to silence,<br/>From trench and from barricade proudly it floats.<br/>The wheels of the rickshaw, the lips of the coolie,<br/>The plow of the peon, all ring out its notes.</small></b></p>
<p><small>And raising this song like a conquering banner,<br/>The People’s Front marches in mighty array,<br/>And raising this song so inspiring and flaming.<br/>Advance to sweep the oppressors away.</small></p>
<p><b><small>And we who have conquered, we sing it so proudly,<br/>The Stalinist epoch we honor as one -<br/>We sing of our new life so splendid and happy,<br/>We sing of the joy of our victories won.</small></b></p>
<p><small>From border to border, o’er valley and mountain,<br/>Where only the aeroplane’s loud motor roars,<br/>Of Stalin the wise, the dearly beloved,<br/>The song of the peoples triumphantly soars.</small></p>
